This application's client and server communicate via messages sent over Unix
domain sockets.  This document describes the format of a message and the use of
such messages in this application.

A message is a serialization of an object. An object consists of a list and a
dictionary (map). Either or both may be empty.  List items and dictionary values
may be bytestrings or objects; dictionary keys must be bytestrings. The format
of a bytestring is application-defined. In this application, bytestrings are
UTF-8-encoded strings.

Here is an example message:

01 04 30 31 32 33 42 34 35 26 01 03 36 37 38 80 80

 ^  ^  ^        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^     ^  ^  ^

 a  b  c           d  e     f  g  h  i        j  k

a. The length of a length is 1.
b. The length of this item is 4.
c. The value of this item is "0123".
d. (0x40) A dictionary follows. (0x02) The length of this key is 2.
e. The value of this key is "45".
f. (0x20) This value is an object. (0x06) The length of this value is 6.
g. The length of a length is 1.
h. The length of this item is 3.
i. The value of this item is "678".
j. End object.
k. End object.

Thus, this message represents the object ("0123" "45"=("678")).
